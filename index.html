                    <p>
                        The Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), also called the toddy cat, is a small member of the family Viverridae
                        native to South and Southeast Asia. Since 2008, it is IUCN Red Listed as Least Concern as it is tolerant
                        of a broad range of habitats. It is widely distributed with large populations that in 2008 were thought
                        unlikely to be declining.[2] In 2012, it was suggested that recent increases in capturing the animals
                        for Kopi Luwak (Civet Coffee) production may constitute a significant threat to wild palm civet populations.[3]

                    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>The Asian palm civet is a small, mottled gray and black viverrid weighing 2 to 5 kg (4.4 to 11.0 lb).
                        It has a body length of about 53 cm (21 in) with a 48 cm (19 in) long tail. Its long, stocky body
                        is covered with coarse, shaggy hair that is usually greyish in color. There is a white mask across
                        the forehead, a small white patch under each eye, a white spot on each side of the nostrils, and
                        a narrow dark line between the eyes. The muzzle, ears, lower legs, and distal half of the tail are
                        black, with three rows of black markings on the body. The tail is without rings, unlike in similar
                        civet species. Anal scent glands emit a nauseating secretion as a chemical defense when threatened
                        or upset.[4] Despite its species name hermaphroditus, the civets (like all other mammals) have two
                        distinct sexes and are not hermaphrodites.</p>

                    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Asian palm civet is native to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Singapore, Peninsular Malaysia,
                        Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei Darussalam, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, the Philippines, and the Indonesian
                        islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Bawean and Siberut. It was introduced to Irian Jaya, the Lesser
                        Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi and Japan. Its presence in Papua New Guinea is uncertain.[2] It usually
                        inhabits primary forests, but also occurs at lower densities in secondary and selectively logged
                        forest.[5] It is also present in parks and suburban gardens with mature fruit trees, fig trees and
                        undisturbed vegetation. Its sharp claws allow climbing of trees and house gutters. In most parts
                        of Sri Lanka, palm civets are considered a nuisance since they litter in ceilings and attics of common
                        households, and make loud noises fighting and moving about at night.
